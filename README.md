# template-front-end-html-bootstrap
Template repository for HTML and CSS (Bootstrap) webpages.

## A few notes

- I downloaded `Emmet` package (which is available for *Atom* and *Sublime*) and used that for quickly creating the templates. You start by creating a new file and saving it `*.html`. After that you type `!html5` and hit `tab` on your keyboard to expand it out to a HTML 5 compliant HTML document.
- There's both versions of Bootstrap 4 in this repo, the only difference being `bootstrap.css` is readable (thus better for development stage) while `bootstrap.min.css` has all the whitespaces stripped out and is the minified version which is used in production. Other than that there should be absolutely no changes in your code to swap out the normal and minified version of Bootstrap CSS file.
